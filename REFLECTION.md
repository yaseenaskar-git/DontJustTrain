# Assignment Reflection

1. What did you ask Copilot to help you build? How did you break down the problem?

I asked Copilot to help me build a website for my fitness brand. I broke down the problem into asking Copilot to build a web app with the basic functionalities a personal trainer needs that applications offer for a price these days.

2. How did your approach to asking questions change as you worked?

I gave Copilot a detailed description of who I am and what I do with regard to personal training. Then I explained the solution I am looking for and gave it a few real-world personal training application examples. Then I asked it to create a similar platform for me with a couple of features only. 

3. What parts of the development process with GitHub Copilot surprised you?

I was surprised that Copilot does everything by itself. Additionally, I was surprised by the number of tools that go into building a website with features such as chats, creating accounts with log-in information, and so on. 

4. What did you learn about the technology you used that you didn't know before?

Actually, I have never worked with JavaScript before, so everything here was new to me, as Copilot coded everything in JS. What I did to expand my knowledge was to ask chatGPT to explain many things to me, so this way, I will not lose my free chats with Copilot as well. 

5. What would you do differently if you had to build this again?

Firstly, I will write down on a piece of paper what I want to create and what features I want to plan everything ahead.

Secondly, sicne I want to create a web app, I will do some research on how a web app is created since I have never worked on one before. 

Thirdly, I will let Copilot know what language I want to code in. This is related to the answer of question 4. 

Finally, I will choose 2-4 simple features, then ask Copilot to add them them 1 by 1, and only move to the next feature when the current feature is completed and tested.
